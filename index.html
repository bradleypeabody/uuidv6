        <h3>UUIDs: A Common Case</h3>

        <p>Universally Unique Identifiers are useful in many scenarios.  And
        <a target="rfc4122" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">RFC 4122</a>
        describes 5 versions, indicated for use in various cases.</p>

        <p>This document describes a proposed sixth version which in the author's
        opinion addresses a relatively minor but nonetheless significant shortcoming
        in the UUID specification, specifically when compared to the Version 1
        UUIDs from the RFC.</p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>

        <p>RFC 4122 is dated July 2005.  Times have changed.  Today, CPUs are
        faster and applications are frequently far more distributed.  <strong>This 
        results in an increased need to generate globally unique identifiers
        on different nodes in a distributed system and have these contain
        properties appropriate for a database primary key.</strong></p>

        <p>The existing RFC comes close, but stops short of describing a UUID
        suitable to this scenario.  Specifically, a value useful for
        this case would have the following properties:

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sorting by its raw bytes results in a sequence equivalent
          to sorting by its
          embedded timestamp,</strong> thus making it naturally more useful as a
          primary key and providing improved reference locality and thus
          insert performance.  (I.e. primary keys that are out of sequence are
          not just useless for sorting, but can also cause unnecessary disk
          access due to occupying significantly different locations in
          the index. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2014/12/19/store-uuid-optimized-way/">[example]</a>)</li>
          <li><strong>The embedded time should be extractable</strong> for use as the
          creation time of the record.</li>
          <li><strong>Global uniqueness,</strong> which is of course a basic requirement
          of all types of UUIDs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unfortunately, none of the existing 5 UUID versions meet all
        3 requirements.  The main issue being that the byte sequence
        for the time field makes meeting the first requirement impossible
        with the existing specification.</p>

<!--         <h3>Useful Scenarios</h3>

        <p>Here are just a few examples of cases where such a UUID would be
        applicable:
        <ul>
          <li>https://www.percona.com/blog/2014/12/19/store-uuid-optimized-way/</li>
          <li>https://blog.codinghorror.com/primary-keys-ids-versus-guids/</li>
          <li>http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?98,49626,172029</li>
        </ul>
 -->
        <h3>Specification for 'Version 6'</h3>

        <p><em>TL;DR: 'Version 6' UUIDs have the date/time encoded from high to low
        bytes (bit-shifting around the version field in order to preserve its
        location) and thus sort correctly by time when treated as an
        opaque bunch of bytes; the clock
        sequence can be used to avoid duplicates generated at the same
        time; it's okay to use random data from a good PRNG in place
        of the MAC address; the rest is the same as RFC&nbsp;4122.</em></p>

        <p>The description here will be kept primarily to the differences
        from what is given in the RFC.</p>

        <h4>Timestamp</h4>

        <p>The only fields that change layout are the ones related to the timestamp.
        The version field retains its same position for backward compatibility,
        so applications can test for the version number in a consistent
        way.  Assuming the timestamp begins as a 60-bit unsigned integer
        (usually implemented as a 64-bit unsigned int with the top 4 bits
        unused), the most significant 48 bits of the timestamp appear
        first (in order from most significant first, toward least significant),
        followed by the 4-bit version field, followed by the remaining 12 bits
        from the timestamp.<p>

        <p>That gives a layout as follows: (timestamp shown in red)</p>

<pre><code><strong>Bytes 0-7:</strong> (each digit shown is hex, 4 bits)
    <span class="color-red">00 00 00 00  00 00</span> 0<span class="color-red">0 00</span>
    |                | ||  |
     ----------------  ||  |
    timestamp          ||  |
    bits 59-12         ||  |
                 version|  |
                         --
                  timestamp
                  bits 11-0

<strong>Bytes 8-15:</strong> (same as RFC 4122)
    00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00
    ||  | |                |
    ||  |  ________________
    ||  |       node
    | --
    | clock seq bits 11-0
    2 bits variant, 2 bits
    are 13-12 of clock seq

<span class="grayish">NOTE: Just to be perfectly clear, even though the bit numbers
are given from high to low, what is being indicated is that
the byte sequence is big-endian, NOT that the bits should somehow
be reversed bit by bit.  I would have used bytes but the version
field is only 4 bits, so it's necessary to describe the fields
in terms of their bit sizes.   Hopefully all that is apparent.</span>
</code></pre>

        <p>Assuming <code>t</code> is a 64-bit unsigned integer (<code>uint64_t</code>)
        containing the timestamp as described in the RFC (in hundred-nanosecond intervals
        since midnight 15 October 1582 UTC), the C code to make the adjustment
        described above would be:

        <p><code>((t &lt;&lt; 4) &amp; 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF0000) | (t &amp; 0x0FFF) | 0x6000</code></p>

        <p><span class="grayish">n.b. (the <code>0x6000</code> value is of course the version number - 6)</span>

        <p>This would then be written in network byte order/big-endian to output
        the first 8 bytes of the UUID, i.e. the first byte would get the value
        <code>(t >> 56)</code> the second would be <code>((t >> 48) &amp; 0xFF)</code>, etc.</p>

        <h4>Clock Sequence</h4>

        <p>In order to prevent duplicates on modern systems where it is very
        possible to have two UUIDs created within the same hundred-nanosecond
        interval, a minor difference is indicated in the behavior of the clock
        sequence field (see RFC <a target="rfc4122" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.1.5">section 4.1.5</a>).  Instead of <a target="rfc4122" 
        href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.2.1.2">returning an
        error or blocking</a> (both of which are undesirable and unnecessary) if
        a duplicate UUID would be returned due to this case, instead the
        clock sequence should be incremented and used for the would-be duplicate ID -
        thus making it unique.  This is the same action described in the RFC
        should the clock move backward and it works just as well in this case.
        In practice, this can be implemented as simple as (C) code like the
        following, run in a critical section:

        <p><pre><code>if (last_timestamp >= this_timestamp) {
    clock_sequence++;
}</code></pre>

        <h4>Node Field Value</h4>

        <p>In section <a target="rfc4122" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.5">4.5
        of the RFC</a> it describes an alternate method for populating the node
        field if the use of a MAC address (IEEE 802) is not desired.  Statements
        earlier in the document (e.g. <em>"For systems with no IEEE address, a
        randomly or pseudo-randomly generated value may be used"</em>) seem to
        indicate that using the MAC address on the system is the more correct
        or normal case.

        <p>So just for clarity I want to specifically point out here that if
        there is a concern about privacy, just use a random value instead -
        that is endorsed as a correct way of generating UUIDs in Version 6.
        As specified in the RFC, random bytes should be generated
        from a high quality source (i.e. use /dev/urandom instead of something
        based on a deterministic algorithm [Mersenne Twister].)  The multicast
        bit should be set as indicated in the RFC.

        <h3>Implementation</h3>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/bradleypeabody/gouuidv6">A reference implementation has been written in Go.</a>  The actual code involved is relatively simple and seems
        to perform decently, feedback and pull requests welcome.<p>

        <h3>Hacks</h3>

        <p>It is somewhat trivial to convert between Version 1 and Version 6
        UUIDs, since the information they contain is the same just in
        different positions.  In environments where an implementation of
        Version 1 exists, converting this output to Version 6 may be
        the simplest implementation.  Here are some examples of how to do this
        in various languages:</p>

        <h4>C:</h4>

<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>
#include &lt;stdint.h>
#include &lt;inttypes.h>
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h>
#include &lt;uuid/uuid.h>

/* Converts UUID version 1 to version 6 in place. */
void uuidv1tov6(uuid_t u) {

  uint64_t ut;
  unsigned char *up = (unsigned char *)u;

  // load ut with the first 64 bits of the UUID
  ut = ((uint64_t)ntohl(*((uint32_t*)up))) &lt;&lt; 32;
  ut |= ((uint64_t)ntohl(*((uint32_t*)&amp;up[4])));

  // dance the bit-shift...
  ut = 
    ((ut >> 32) &amp; 0x0FFF) | // 12 least significant bits
    (0x6000) | // version number
    ((ut >> 28) &amp; 0x0000000FFFFF0000) | // next 20 bits
    ((ut &lt;&lt; 20) &amp; 0x000FFFF000000000) | // next 16 bits
    (ut &lt;&lt; 52); // 12 most significant bits

  // store back in UUID
  *((uint32_t*)up) = htonl((uint32_t)(ut >> 32));
  *((uint32_t*)&amp;up[4]) = htonl((uint32_t)(ut));

}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

  uuid_t u;
  char str[37];

  uuid_generate_time(u);

  uuid_unparse(u, str);
  printf("UUIDv1: %s\n", str);

  uuidv1tov6(u);

  uuid_unparse(u, str);
  printf("UUIDv6: %s\n", str);

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <h4>Python 2/3:</h4>

<pre><code>import uuid

def uuidv1tov6(u):
  uh = u.hex
  tlo1 = uh[:5]
  tlo2 = uh[5:8]
  tmid = uh[8:12]
  thig = uh[13:16]
  rest = uh[16:]
  uh6 = thig + tmid + tlo1 + '6' + tlo2 + rest
  return uuid.UUID(hex=uh6)

u = uuidv1tov6(uuid.uuid1())

</code></pre>
